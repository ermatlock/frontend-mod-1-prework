## Section 3 Reflection

1. What are two points from the Growth Mindset article and/or video that either resonated with you, or were brand new to you?

Challenge seeking behavior really resonates with me. I can't say that historically I have been a challenge seeking person, but I am very excited to focus on staying in that mindset as much as possible. It reminds me of a creative firm that had a huge sign in the main lobby of their building that said "Fail Harder". If you aren't failing then you aren't learning.

The concept of mindfulness applied to refocusing when you find yourself drifting out of growth mindset also speaks to me. I want to keep my eye out for those moments to know that whenever I feel out of my depth, or that something seems daunting, that it's actually a cue to keep going.

1. In which ways do you currently demonstrate a Growth Mindset? In which ways do you _not_?

Joke: How do you get to Carnegie Hall? Practice, practice, practice! As a musician I am pretty familiar with the concept of practice. I learned early on that the more I run through things and try new things, the better and more proficient I will get.
I also enjoy tackling a challenging problem, however sometimes I get more focused on the solution than the process. I could do better to stay process and iteration oriented, and not spend too much time trying to find the perfect way to do something. The efficiency will come with the experience and confidence from building my skills, but the process will always involve pushing a bit outside my comfort zone, so embrace the process!  

1. Think of a web or mobile application you use regularly. Where is an example of a place that the developers probably use Arrays? Explain.

MailChimp likely uses an array as a collection of an indexed list of all the subscribed members of a newsletter. Each subscriber's email would be listed in the array, and whenever that newsletter goes out, it is sent to all the subscribed members.  

1. In your own words, explain what an Array method is.

An array method is a specific function that can be used on an array. For instance `push()` is a function that will add elements to the end of an array.

1. What is the purpose of a loop? When we would use a loop in conjunction with array vs. without?

The purpose of a loop is to iterate a specific function. Rather than writing many lines of code performing the same function, we can accomplish the same task much more efficiently by looping. In the case of looping through an array, it gives us the ability to perform the same function on each element within the array as needed. For instance, if we had a collection of names and we wanted to print a string saying "Welcome <name>!", we could loop through each name in the array and print the result to the console.
We can also use a loop without an array to simply repeat a function. A simple version of this would be a loop that counted from 1 to 100. In this case we can just use the for function and loop it until it reached 100.

1. If you had to teach a 5 year old about loops, how would you explain it?

In code, a loop is when you tell a computer program to do something a bunch of times, which is something computers are very good at. If I wanted to type out all the numbers from 1 to 100, it would be much faster for the computer to use a loop than for me to type out each number by myself.

1. What questions do you still have about Arrays and loops?

If you wanted to perform a loop on an array but you wanted to exclude certain items from the array, could you do so in the same code block?
