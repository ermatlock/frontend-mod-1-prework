## Section 2 Reflection

1. Regarding the blog posts in Part A, how do you feel about asking questions? Do you tend to ask them too soon, or wait too long, or somewhere in between?

I tend to wait too long. I like to think I can figure it out, or that somehow that I will learn the thing better if I figure it out on my own. The reality is that I may be wasting time learning something because I have hit a roadblock. If someone can guide me to a solution I will still learn it! As the "Dumb Questions" article said, the dumb thing is to spend a lot of time searching and searching, when you could have just hit someone up.

1. In this section, we removed some of the supports that you had in Section 1. We didn't give the directions for how to run a file in node, and really sent you off to learn about functions by exploring several outside resources. How did that feel? What was uncomfortable about it? How did it support your learning?

Overall it was helpful to have to look at different options, do some searches and come up with an approach that I felt would work. I feel like in trying different things out I picked up a lot of practical understanding. It was uncomfortable at times and I did have a few "stuck" moments, but it felt good to see the code work and realize i had figured it out.

1. What is a conditional statement? Give one example of a daily life conditional. Give one example of where a conditional is probably used in a web application you use.

Conditional statements are true/false statements that can be used to give the computer a set of different paths to take based on whether that statement is true or false.
Daily life conditional: You must have your keys to start your car. If you have your keys, you can start your car. If you don't have your keys, you cannot start your car.
Web application conditional: In a video streaming site such as Netflix, your ability to play most content is conditional upon seeing that you are have paid for the current month. If true, you may stream your show. If false, you may not stream your show and will be asked to pay your subscription.  


1. How do you add multiple conditions to an `if` statement? In your own words, explain how to program reads them and determines what to do.

By using `else if` you can create multiple conditions, meaning you can have more than one outcome. `else if` logs a specific condition, while `else` logs a condition that is anything other than the other conditions you have created.

1. What tools are available to you, as a developer, if you want to check that TWO conditions are met? Or, if you want to check that 1 of 2 conditions are met, before running a block of code?

Using the && operator gives you the ability to run two true/false conditions against each other to make sure both conditions are met. If either condition is false, the result will be false. The || operator will return a true result if either condition is true.

1. What questions do you still have about `if` statements and/or functions?

Would `if`/`else if` statements be used on a very long list of conditions or are there other methods to branch multiple paths?
